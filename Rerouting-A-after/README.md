# Exercise A1 and A2: answers

To see an answer to Exercise A1 in the [README](../Rerouting-A-before/README.md), see 
[Itinerary.java](./src/routing/Itinerary.java) and [RoutingService.java](./src/routing/RoutingService.java).
`Itinerary.truncateAt` has been implemented and used. We didn't do any further refactoring.

For an answer to [Exercise 2](../Rerouting-A-before/exercise2.md), see 
[RoutingServiceTest.java](./src/routing/RoutingServiceTest.java)
