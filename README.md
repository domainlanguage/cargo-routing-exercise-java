# cargo-routing-exercise-java

Welcome to the DDD Immersion Cargo Routing Exercise.

This project requires Java 11 to be installed. You can get up to date builds from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

To verify that everything was setup correctly please run the following steps (in Eclipse or IntelliJ):

1. Expand the `Project` view to the left.
2. Right-click on `Rerouting-B-1-before`, and in the context menu select `Run 'All Tests'`
3. If you see three passed tests, you are all set!

Please leave the remaining modules closed, we will get to them later on during the exercises!
